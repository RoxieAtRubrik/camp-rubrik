# Objective: Explore Rubrik APIs

In this lab, you will perform the following tasks:

* Access Rubrik API documentation
* Make an API using the API playground

APIs provide a programmatic method to query, configure, and control nearly all of the operations of the Rubrik software.

## Getting Started

Rubrik is built on an API-first platform to integrate seamlessly with third party solutions to achieve as-a-Service delivery. SDKs are available for users to build their own integrations or users can plug into configuration management tools \(i.e. Puppet, Chef, SaltStack, Ansible\) to simplify deployments across hundreds of servers or VMs. Customers commonly integrate backup with service catalogs \(i.e. ServiceNow, vRealize Automation, and vCloud Director\) to automate manual processes and deliver self-service access and recovery.
